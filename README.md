# Conway's Game Of Life (Made in Unity)
A simple version of Conway's Game Of Life but with a twist. Each cell of every organism has a slight chance of developing cancer -indicated in red- if it does the organism becomes fixed, if other organisms touch it they become infected as well.
Developed as a lab exercise for an undergrad introduction to Bioinformatics course. It has no bearing on how cancer actually works, and carries the term very loosely.
